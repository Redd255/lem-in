# Lemin Ant Simulation

## Overview

This project simulates the movement of ants through a network of interconnected rooms, finding optimal paths while avoiding traffic jams and adhering to various constraints.

## Features

- Validates input for errors, such as invalid room names, duplicate definitions, or missing start/end rooms.
- Handles multiple paths and distributes ants to avoid congestion.
- Ensures that ants follow the shortest available paths.
- Simulates movement, displaying only the ants that moved in each turn.
- Manages errors gracefully, providing meaningful messages without unexpected crashes.
